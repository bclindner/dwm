# bclindner's `dwm` fork

this is a reconfiguration of [dwm](dwm.suckless.org), a light tiling window manager.

this fork has the following features:

* custom color scheme and keybinds
* the movestack, shiftview, and uselessgaps patches

## requirements

this config assumes `rofi` is already installed, and `chromium-browser` is the user's primary browser.

## compiling

just run `make` and `sudo make install` to install or update dwm. easy as that.
